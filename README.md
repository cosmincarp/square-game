# square-game

## Why?
Clone of http://gameaboutsquares.com/ written in Java, for educational purpose.

My first experience creating a game, and my introduction in OOP, OpenGL, and Java. It uses lwjgl-2.9.1 and slick2d.

It was developed more as a "tech research", as the gameplay mechanic is mostly unfinished - only 2 test levels and one working editor.

### Editor
```1, 2, 3 ``` - select a tile

``` q ``` - removes selected tile

``` left click ``` - put tile down

``` w, a, s, d ``` - rotate tiles

``` z, x, c, v ``` - change tile color

``` space ``` - start / stop level test
